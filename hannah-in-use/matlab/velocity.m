function v = velocity(pos, varargin);
%computes velocity from position data as velocity(pos, varargin). if you put a 1 in varargin, velocity will be directional from junction of forced arms (380, 360)
%computes velocity. input a [#ofpoints, 3] vector, where first column is time, second is x, third is y
% IF YOU ARE USING POSITION FROM THE BOX PUT ANY NUMBER INTO VARARGIN
% you can import your csv file as such:
% x = load('pos.csv');
% v = noiselessVelocity(x);
%
% returns velocities in cm/s and time stamp vector
% Uses a discrete wavelet transform with a spline mother wavelet to compute
% numerical derivitive
